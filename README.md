# cVec

This project provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C.

## Installation

_todo: Need to work out how to package_

## Usage

Example code given in [example.c](./example.c).

- Functions in the linked list can be found in [list.h](./list/list.h) and act similarly to to [std::vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector#Member_functions).
